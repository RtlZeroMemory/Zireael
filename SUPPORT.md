# Support

Zireael is a low-level engine. Support works best when issues include precise, reproducible information.

## Where to ask

- **Bugs / feature requests:** GitHub Issues
- **Security issues:** follow `SECURITY.md`

## What to include

- OS and terminal emulator (name + version)
- Zireael version (tag or commit SHA)
- Engine ABI + drawlist/event batch versions requested
- Minimal repro (prefer a small C program or a wrapper snippet)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs/traces (if enabled) and any captured drawlist/event bytes if relevant
