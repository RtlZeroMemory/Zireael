# C API reference (generated)

The C API reference is generated from the public headers under `include/zr/`
using Doxygen and published as part of the docs site.

## Open the reference

If you are browsing the repository without GitHub Pages, you can build the
docs locally (see `docs-user/getting-started/build-and-test.md`) and open the
generated HTML under `out/site/c-api/`.
