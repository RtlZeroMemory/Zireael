# API reference (Doxygen)

The public C headers live under `include/zr/`.

The published site includes a Doxygen-generated API reference under:

- `.../api/` (built in CI and deployed to GitHub Pages)

If you are reading this page locally:

- run the docs build (it generates the `api/` directory during the build), then open the site.

## Next steps

- [ABI → C ABI Reference](abi/c-abi-reference.md)
- [Internal Specs → Header Layering](HEADER_LAYERING.md)
